A custom folk of [Bungeecord](https://github.com/SpigotMC/BungeeCord)

A list of small tweaks I made:

- Adjust field position in class ServerPing to make the ping response more vanilla-like
- Fix #2968: Dimension change screen doesn't show when switching from >=1.16 server to <1.16 server within the same dimension
